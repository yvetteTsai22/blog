# About

ğŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m YY â€” an explorer at heart, turning wild ideas into intelligent systems.

âœ¨ Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve wandered through the world of AI â€”
building chatbots that talk, automating boring stuff,
and playing with language models, image generators,
and all the magical tools shaping the next tech wave ğŸŒŠ.

ğŸ§  This blog is where I think out loud, share experiments,
and connect the dots between curiosity, creativity, and code ğŸ’­ğŸ’».

ğŸš€ Welcome to my little corner of the internet â€”
where ideas meet intelligence.
